=head1 NAME

get_flash_videos - Video downloader for various Flash-based video hosting sites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_flash_videos [OPTION]... URL [FILENAME]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Download the Flash video from the web page given in C<URL> saving as
C<FILENAME>. If no filename is supplied, a suitable one will be chosen.

I<get-flash-videos> attempts to support many video sites, therefore there is no
list of supported sites in this manual page as it frequently changes, see the
website for a list.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

Print extra debugging information.

=item B<-p>, B<--play>

Begin playing the video once enough of the file has been downloaded.

=item B<--player=I<CMD>>

Specify the player to use for the C<--play> option. Any occurrence of C<%s> in
this string will be replaced with the filename of the video (appropriately
shell escaped).

The default is to use mplayer:

  mplayer -really-quiet %s

You may wish to automatically delete the video after you have viewed it:

  mplayer -really-quiet %s; rm %s

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>

Be quiet, only print errors.

=item B<-u>, B<--update>

Check the I<get-flash-videos> website for a newer version. If a newer version is
available download it and replace the running version with it. You will need to
run this as a user with permission to write to the location of the
F<get_flash_videos> program. If you installed using a packaging system it is
recommended to use that to upgrade, not this option.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Print the version of I<get_flash_videos>.

=item B<-y>, B<--yes>

Do not prompt with any questions, just say 'yes'. This means either literally
yes, or the default option if choosing from a list.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

On startup I<get_flash_videos> will read the configuration files located at
F</etc/get_flash_videosrc> and then F<~/.get_flash_videosrc>.

The files follow a simple C<name = value> convention where the name matches the
long version of the command line options. For example if you want to specify the
default player, to always say yes and to always run the player the file might
look like:

  player = my-video-player %s 2>/dev/null; rm -f %s
  yes

  # Always play the video
  play

Options given on the command line will override these options, with the
exception that it is not currently possible to disable an option enabled in the
configuration file from the command line.

=head1 BUGS

Third party sites are a moving target therefore it is possible support for some
of the sites may not work correctly. First check that you are using the latest
version.
