get-flash-videos (1.7-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Add sites:
    - Blip (explicit support -- mostly worked with generic before)

  * Fix sites:
    - Dailymotion (embedded videos)
    - Google Video (some files didn't work)
    - Break (minor change to embedding method)
    - BBC (Support for playing live streams, needs a patched rtmpdump:
       http://get-flash-videos.googlecode.com/svn/misc/rtmpdump-fcsubscribe.patch,
       this is still rather buggy)

  * New --play option, for playing the video as well as downloading it.
    There is also an associated --player option to specify the player to use.

  * New --debug and --quiet options to print more and less output respectively.

  * Now reads config files from /etc/get_flash_videosrc and
    ~/.get_flash_videosrc, in a simple name = value format that matches the
    command line options.

  * Report progress for RTMP downloads in the same way as HTTP downloads.

  * Release now includes a Debian package.
