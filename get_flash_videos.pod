=head1 NAME

get_flash_videos - Video downloader for various Flash-based video hosting sites

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get_flash_videos [OPTION]... URL [FILENAME]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Download the Flash video from the web page given in C<URL> saving as
C<FILENAME>, if no filename is supplied a suitable one would be chosen.

I<get-flash-videos> attempts to support many video sites, therefore there is no
list of supported sites in this manual page as it frequently changes, see the
website for a list.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p>, B<--play>

Begin playing the video once enough of the file has been downloaded.

=item B<-P I<CMD>>, B<--player=I<CMD>>

Specify the player to use for the C<--play> option. Any occurrence of C<%s> in
this string will be replaced with the filename of the video (appropriately
shell escaped).

The default is to use mplayer:

  mplayer -really-quiet %s

You may wish to automatically delete the video after you have viewed it:

  mplayer -really-quiet %s; rm %s

=item B<-u>, B<--update>

Check the I<get-flash-videos> website for a newer version. If a newer version is
available download it and replace the running version with it. You will need to
run this as a user with permission to write to the location of the
F<get_flash_videos> program. If you installed using a packaging system it is
recommended to use that to upgrade, not this option.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Print the version of I<get_flash_videos>.

=item B<-y>, B<--yes>

Do not prompt with any questions, just say 'yes'. This means either literally
yes, or the default option if choosing from a list.

=head1 BUGS

Third party sites are a moving target therefore it is possible support for some
of the sites may not work correctly. First check that you are using the latest
version.
