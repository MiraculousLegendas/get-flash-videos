}}}

You can then simply run the downloaded script.

== Other Linux/Unix-like OS ==

Install the Perl modules WWW::Mechanize (required) and XML::Simple (required for some sites). Preferably install the packaged versions of these provided by your distribution. If you can't, install the modules off [http://search.cpan.org/ CPAN] - follow [http://code.google.com/p/get-flash-videos/wiki/CPANGuide our short walkthrough] or read the [http://search.cpan.org/~jhi/perl-5.8.0/pod/perlmodinstall.pod perlmodinstall] documentation for more extensive information.

Then run the following commands in a terminal, this installs get-flash-videos system-wide.

{{{
 sudo wget http://get-flash-videos.googlecode.com/files/get_flash_videos-1.24 -O /usr/local/bin/get_flash_videos
 sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/get_flash_videos
}}}

Then, to download something:
{{{
 get_flash_videos url..

== Windows ==

Install [http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/ ActivePerl], making sure you tell the installer to add perl's bin directory to your PATH.

Install the Perl modules WWW::Mechanize (required) and XML::Simple (required for some sites). You can install these using ActivePerl's PPM tool.

Save get-flash-videos somewhere on your hard disk, for example c:\flash.

 Start -> Run -> cmd
 perl c:/flash/get_flash_videos url

We haven't tested rtmpdump on win32.

{{{
 curl -o get_flash_videos http://get-flash-videos.googlecode.com/files/combined-get_flash_videos-1.24

{{{
 ./get_flash_videos url..
}}}

See UsageExamples for more.

Note you may also need to install the Perl modules XML::Simple and Data::AMF for support for some sites.

= rtmpdump =

get_flash_videos can download videos from servers over RTMP, this needs rtmpdump. You can get a copy of rtmpdump from http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu. If you compile it or use an unpackaged version you should chmod it as executable and copy this to
somewhere on your PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin). If you have problems compiling, make sure you have libssl-dev installed.

= Using get_flash_videos =

See the [http://get-flash-videos.googlecode.com/svn/misc/get_flash_videos manpage] for details on how to use get_flash_videos.
