#summary A list of broken sites

= Introduction =

All of these sites have worked in the past, but for some reason are not working now.

== Why are so many broken? ==
Many sites update the way they handle video every few months. The get-flash-videos project is currently run by a benevolent community of volunteers and cannot constantly keep up with the many issues.

== How was this list created? ==
There is a script in the get-flash-videos source called t/url.t. It runs get-flash-videos for every site using a predetermined url. Some of these video in t/urls may be have bene removed from the site, but the plugin may still work.
