#summary Overview of how to work with get-flash-videos
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

First it's important to understand that the distributed `get_flash_videos`
differs from the version you'll find in the subversion repository. This is
to make distribution easy (just one file for people to install, the update
mechanism can only update the one file, etc).

However it's obviously easier to develop on if the code is modular. This means
adding a site (see AddingSite) is just a matter of adding a site specific module.
The code can also be run in either form, so that there is no need to generate a
combined version while developing.

These combined versions are generated by a makefile and the script
`combine-perl.pl`, generating them is just a matter of typing `make`.
